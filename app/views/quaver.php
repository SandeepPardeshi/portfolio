          <p>Music is an important part of our lives because it is a way to express our thoughts as well as our feelings. Most people consider music as a way to escape from the pain of life, for me it has always been my core strength molding me into a better person day by day.</p>
          <p>The day I held a guitar for the very first time in my life, the first stroke to the six strings and my friends burst out of laughter. Despite being bad I could feel the divinity in that sound. Time went by and I practiced hard to learn it. I still canâ€™t say that I have mastered it. Every day you can learn something new and craft something new.</p>
          <p>I feel that music has the potential to improve my listening and understanding abilities. Every song has a meaning and a message that the singer wants to convey to its audience. Even when listening to instrumental music you can understand what the musician is feeling as they perform. Thank you for your support.</p>
